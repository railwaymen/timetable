To get it running locally run the following after cloning the repository:

```
bundle install

bundle exec rake db:create
bundle exec rake db:seed
bundle exec rails s
```

Visit localhost:3000 and login using following credentails :

| email                    | password | role            |
|--------------------------|----------|-----------------|
| admin@example.com        | password | admin           |
| manager@example.com      | password | manager         |

After login on admin account you can create your own projects for the clients and accounts for your employees.

You can also generate some example data to play with the application by running:

```
bundle exec rake populate_dev_data
```
